          <h2>Article Response</h2>
          <h3><em>24 October 2016</em></h3>

          <p>For my third blog post, I chose to read Richard Fink's article titled "Webfonts on the Prairie", where he discusses
             and responds to Adam Morse's claim that the world would be better off without webfonts. Morse argues that system fonts
             are perfectly adequate because they do not fail with slow internet connection and that webfonts do not solve a specific
              problem for the consumers. Fink’s rebuttle was that although there are some minor problems with webfonts on slow connection
              browsers, the overall benefits and the strides that the tech world has made to ensure faster internet outweigh the concerns. </p>

          <p>Fink states that over sixty percent of websites use webfonts, which is a whopping increase from the measly two percent in 2011.
             This increase showed me that more and more people are focused on the aesthetics and mood of not only their site, but also their brand.
              Webfonts add life and personality to an otherwise common looking webpage, and allows the user to get a feel of the type of environment
               and message the creator intended to give off. </p>

          <p>This article has convinced me that it's in a designer’s nature to use webfonts in their designs because it makes them unique and stands
             out from the rest of the system-font websites. I will strive to include webfonts in my future projects to more accurately reflect the
              mood that I want my website to present. </p>
