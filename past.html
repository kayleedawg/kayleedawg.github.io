    <p>The history of drawing can be traced back to the beginning of man,
         using nature and hand-made tools to create artwork on nearby resources.
        However, the technological advances that have allowed for digitization of
         drawing has created a whole tier of digital drawing tablets, and there are still
        improvements being made every day. </p>

    <p>The beginning of digital drawing tablets was in 1888, when Elisha Gray created the
         Teleautograph, which was a tablet that monitored electrical impulses recorded at a sending
          station and was then transmitted to pens at receiving stations that wrote out the message
          or picture. This was the first device that sent drawings and signatures, and was mostly used
          for bank and hospital paperwork that needed to be signed. The next step was in 1957, when Tom
          L. Dimond invented the Stylator, which sent drawings directly to a computer rather than a
          receiving station, and it also had handwriting recognition. M.R. Davis and T.O. Ellis of the
          RAND Corporation were responsible for the next advancement in 1964, when the RAND Tablet was
          released. This was a digital graphic device measuring 10x10 inches and included a connected
          stylus, more like tablets of recent history. This tablet also transmitted drawings directly
          to a computer, and was valued at $18,000. In 1979, the first Apple tablet was released, the
          Graphics Tablet, valued at $650. This tablet again included a stylus to draw with, and was
          used as an accessory to the Apple II computer. Another version of this tablet, created by
          musician Tod Rundgren, was released that enabled the user to select from almost one hundred
           colors and many brush strokes in order to provide more distinction in their artwork.
          In 2000, Bill Gates at Microsoft proposed the Microsoft Tablet PC, which was ahead of its
          time and was not popular until a few years after its release. This tablet did not require
          connection to a computer for power, but instead acted as its own device, much like the iPad
           of today. </p>
