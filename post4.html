          <h2>Responsive Website</h2>
          <h3><em>November 2016</em></h3>

          <p>For my responsive website critique, I was immediately draw to the
            Design Made in Germany Magazine because it had a cat and other animals
            in its illustration. The site was in German, so I translated the page to
             get a better understanding of its content. In a laptop view, the initial
              header of the animals covers part of the title, which is a little confusing
               if someone were to randomly come across the page, but the illustration is
                really nice to look at. Scrolling down, there is a transparent grey box
                 that has the text, which another cool animal illustration as the background
                 image. The box is not transparent enough for the image to take away from the text though.</p>

	          <p>I have the iPhone 6, which is one of the breakpoints I chose to analyze. On the phone,
               the images are more cut off and the text is closely grouped together. The navigation bar
                is greatly reduced to just arrows rather than being able to hover over a number and get the
                article title on a laptop. The header image is gone completely, which takes away from the
                initial interpretation of the website for me. </p>
	          <p>On an iPad, the website still retains a lot of the layout design that is on a laptop. The
              full navigation bar and content is back, and all of the images are in the same position.
              Everything is clearly labeled and the website is very easy to navigate. Overall, the website
              is very well designed, and the color scheme goes perfectly with the illustrations. I do prefer
              the laptop or iPad design however, because I think the drawings add a lot to the website and
              shouldnâ€™t be compromised on mobile devices. </p>
