          <h2>Coding Experience</h2>
          <h3><em>10 October 2016</em></h3>

          <p>WHEN CREATING THE “Our Roasters” page, I actually didn’t run into many problems and I was pleasantly surprised
            with how fast I was able to get the page up and running. Since we had already completed most of the html and all
            of the css, I was able to copy and paste a lot of the coding into the new page. The only changes I had to make was
             to the images and the increased amount of text within the article.</p> 

          <p>My only problem was a small error in spelling,
              which prevented the bottom picture of the coffee beans from showing up on the page. Other than that, each checkpoint
               that I tested worked on the first try, and the page was linked and ready after I discovered my spelling error.
               Overall, it was a pretty easy assignment given that most of the coding was already completed. </p>
