          <h2>Website Critique</h2>
          <byline>DATE</byline>
          
          <p>For my first blog post, I chose to analyze Alexandre Rochet’s website.
             The main title page looks simple, and a little ambiguous at first glance,
              but after moving your mouse you see its function. The letters move around
              to more clearly form the name “Alexandre Rochet” and it is a fun and simple
               way to present the website. The white text that reads “explore the projects”
                stands out against the dark black background, and can be easily recognized as
                a link button. The website relies a lot on movement and interaction, and is
                used to showcase various brands and ads. </p>

          <p>After clicking on a project, a new page opens that has a wide range of information,
            such as the role, date and a small blurb about the campaign. Upon scrolling down,
            there are examples of different advertisements of the product that show how the company choose to market it to the public. </p>

          <p>The color scheme is mostly blacks, whites, and grays with little pops of color in various ads.
            This produces a very clean and sleek look, which works well with the top tier designer brands that
             are being showcased. The hierarchy is organized by having the most important info at the top,
              the user would have to keep scrolling down to view the ad examples, which hold less importance. </p>

          <p>I think the website is very well done, and is fairly easy to use. The design is very sophisticated
             and seems to reflect the designer’s personal style, which is the purpose of an online portfolio.
              I think it is a very creative way to showcase work that shows the type of design to expect and the
              computer/organizational skills that come with making a functional website. However, there are a lot of moving parts,
               which can be a tad overwhelming when trying to read and process the text. If the user keeps scrolling, there is
               more and more information to be seen, which can be tiresome if you just want to see everything at once on the page.
             In addition, the navigation buttons are not labeled, which could make it difficult for less-tech savvy users,
             but I was able to pick it up quickly. Overall, I think this website works very well and if I had more time,
             I would want to explore it in full. </p>

          <h2>Coding Experience</h2>

          <p>When creating the “Our Roasters” page, I actually didn’t run into many problems and I was pleasantly surprised
            with how fast I was able to get the page up and running. Since we had already completed most of the html and all
            of the css, I was able to copy and paste a lot of the coding into the new page. The only changes I had to make was
             to the images and the increased amount of text within the article. My only problem was a small error in spelling,
              which prevented the bottom picture of the coffee beans from showing up on the page. Other than that, each checkpoint
               that I tested worked on the first try, and the page was linked and ready after I discovered my spelling error.
               Overall, it was a pretty easy assignment given that most of the coding was already completed. </p>
